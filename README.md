# CNN from scratch in Python

I have coded a CNN from scratch to classify images 
from Mnist dataset of hand-written numbers and other images.
I have decided that I wasn't satisfied therefore it is being coded again more organized and with less problems I hope.

When I fnished coding it I would like to do optimisation in gradient descent and also apply it to more complex images such as Ciphar-10.
